 * A Grow-only Set.

 * <p>A Grow-only Set can have elements added to it, but cannot have elements removed from it.
 *
 * <p>Care needs to be taken to ensure that the serialized value of elements in the set is stable.
 * For example, if using protobufs, the serialized value of any maps contain in the protobuf is not
 * stable, and can yield a different set of bytes for the same logically equal element. Hence maps,
 * should be avoided. Additionally, some changes in protobuf schemas which are backwards compatible
 * from a protobuf perspective, such as changing from sint32 to int32, do result in different
 * serialized bytes, and so must be avoided.
